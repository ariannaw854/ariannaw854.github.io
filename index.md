### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    The entire project of Lab 2 was memorable because I considered it my first real win in computer science. The weeks leading up to this lab, I was really frustrated because I kept hitting roadblock after roadblock trying to upload Ubuntu. While each part of the lab was fairly simple, I specifically  enjoyed this lab because learning to lint helped me get accustomed to the C++ style guide and how to write cleaner code. 

* Lab 3 

    In Part 3 of Lab 3 my partner and I created a program that took one userâ€™s guess and created a high-low guessing game for the second user. This is one of my favorite labs because it was the foundation for future variations of this lab. In the future we advanced the program by using random numbers and keeping the number hidden. From this lab I was able to learn how to independently design a program and develop as a programmer. 

* Lab 6 

    In part 1 of Lab 6, my partner and I created a program that recreates a specific desired pattern using loops. I enjoyed creating this program because it taught me to break through the habit of coding lazily. Prior to completing this lab I would solely focus on whether the program would give me the outcome I desired over writing efficient and clean code. However, throughout the completion of this lab, I quickly learned the importance of testing and telling the computer exactly what I want it to do.
